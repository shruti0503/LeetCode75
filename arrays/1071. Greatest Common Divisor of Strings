The function first checks if the concatenation of str1 and str2 is equal to the concatenation of str2 and str1. 
If this condition is true, it means that both strings share a common prefix, which could be the greatest common divisor. 
In this case, the function returns a substring of str1 that starts at index 0 and has a length equal to the greatest common divisor of the lengths of str1 and str2.

This is a C++ function named gcdOfStrings that takes two strings str1 and str2 as input and returns the greatest common divisor of the two strings. 
The function uses the fact that the greatest common divisor of two strings is a prefix of both strings.

The function first checks if the concatenation of str1 and str2 is equal to the concatenation of str2 and str1.
If this condition is true, it means that both strings share a common prefix, which could be the greatest common divisor. 
In this case, the function returns a substring of str1 that starts at index 0 and has a length equal to the greatest common divisor of the lengths of str1 and str2.

If the above condition is not true, it means that there is no common prefix between str1 and str2, so the function returns an empty string.

The function uses the substr method of the string class to extract a substring from str1.
The substr method takes two arguments: the starting index of the substring and the length of the substring.
In this case, the starting index is 0 and the length is calculated using the gcd function, which takes the lengths of str1 and str2 as input and returns their greatest common divisor.

For example, if str1 = "abab" and str2 = "ab", the function would return the string "ab", which is the greatest common divisor of the two input strings.

 string gcdOfStrings(string str1, string str2) {
        if(str1 + str2 == str2 + str1){
            return str1.substr(0, gcd(str1.length(), str2.length()));
        }
        return "";
    }
